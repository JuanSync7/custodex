"""Pillar B — document↔document dependencies + suspect-link drift (EPIC B).

The doc↔doc analogue of code↔doc drift, built on the proven Doorstop model: a
document declares it ``depends_on`` an upstream document (the DECLARATION lives in
config, the source of truth K2); the downstream carries a per-edge baseline STAMP
— the upstream's content hash at last review — in its ``cdm.upstream_hashes``
front matter (machine-managed, exactly like ``cdm.fingerprint``). When the
upstream's body changes, the stamp no longer matches and the edge is **suspect**
until a human re-confirms it with ``cdx resolve --edge`` (the Doorstop ``clear``).

This mirrors :mod:`custodex.ownership`: a pure detection core (no clock, no
network, no new dependency — K0/K1/K10) that both the engine/`cdx` CLI and the
server drive, plus one clearly-isolated impure writer (:func:`stamp_edges`) used
only by the mutation commands (``link`` / ``resolve`` / ``monitor --apply``),
never by the detect-only ``check``.
